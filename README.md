A repository for the game dev course.
Here I will be posting all my progress during this course, consisting of 6 blog posts and a course project game.

#1 Roll-A-Ball

Roll a Ball, a beginner tutorial offered by Unity. This was my first interaction with game development and Unity. As I never did any similar programming, it was a completely new concept to wrap my head around. The mini game, as the name suggests, is a game that has a sphere as the player, that then rolls around and does some things.

First challenge was setting up the workspace and actually making the sphere. I waited for 2 classes to pass, before I started working on this tutorial. This helped as we learned about the editor itself and scripting during those two classes. With that, it was time to finally make this game. Having a mini ball that rolls around on a platform and falls down into an endless pit, maybe sounds sad to experienced devs, but for me it was a successful start to my first ever game.

The tutorial was quite straightforward, I didn't stray away from it, well, other than instead of making everything in shades of gray, I added purple, pink and blue. When the time came to make obstacles, I put them in a star shape, very bold. I hope to experiment more in future with shapes, textures and colours, find a way to express myself uniquely. It was fun to play around with physics, gravity, mass of an object and how it can be pushed around or collected.

After I finished the first part of the game, where you, the ball, roll around and collect all the cubes and win, I started with the AI enemy. I thought this was going to be very complicated, but I was pleasantly surprised. I made a mistake the first time by somehow adding a constant radius my enemy had to keep from the sphere, so when you played it, it would kind of just spin around you > <. After spending some time trying to fix this, I deleted the object and started anew. This time it was successful. 

With this, the game came to an end. I am content with the results, but as we have more classes, I will strive to get better at Unity, by bettering my mini game. Perhaps, adding some new levels, maybe a timer or a faster enemy, maybe more obstacles.
